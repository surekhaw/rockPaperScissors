## Rock, Paper, Scissors

At The Last Mile, our Web Development Fundamentals ("WDF") students learn basic javascript skills.  One of the required assignments by which they demonstrate their mastery of these skills is by creating a Rock, Paper, Scissors game.  A demonstration video is available for students to view so they can get an idea of how the end result should look.  

This project is an exemplar created for The Last Mile WDF students to review after they submit their assignment that mimics the demonstration video so they can see a possible solution for the assignment and compare their code for ideas and improvements.  Because the purpose of the assignment is to practice javascript skills, there is minimal HTML and CSS.  

This project was created for The Last Mile while employed as a Web Development Education Apprentice and is herein included with permission of The Last Mile.  

Instructions:
Click on the key 'r' to choose 'rock,' 'p' to choose 'paper,' or 's' to choose scissors.  The computer will then randomly choose either 'rock,' 'paper,' or 'scissors' as well.  The choices are then compared and the results of whether the user won, lost, or tied against the computer are displayed.  A running tally of wins, losses, and ties are displayed throughout the game as well.
